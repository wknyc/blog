== Changelog ==
1.5 - New Features
=
* SPEED!  Javascript is now compressed and loads ONLY on pages with a map
* You can now edit marker titles and body using full HTML!  Look for a visual editor in the next version...
* Removed 'directions' tabs and went back to links.  This just seems simpler to me, but let me know if you object.
* You can now add markers by lat/lng.  Use the fields to precisely enter the location or, if you want the marker to 'snap' to the nearest street address, then enter the lat/lng in the address field instead, e.g. "-35.03, -32.001"
* Directions link display has been enhanced
* Added option for address correction.  If you choose 'as entered' the addresses will appear just as you enter them.  Choose 'corrected' to display a corrected version from Google.  For example, the corrected version of "1 infinite loop" is "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA, 95014, USA".  Look for more correction options in the next version...
* Internationalization has been improved and all visible texts should now be available for translation
* Changed 'caption' to 'title'.  If you have CSS assigned to class "mapp-overlay-caption" please change it to "mapp-overlay-title"
* By default, MapPress will zoom your map to show all markers when you save the map.  If you don't want this function, you can set a checkbox to manually set the map center and zoom
* You can set the map type (hybrid, street, etc.) by selecting it in the post-edit or page-edit screen.  Whatever you select is what will be displayed. * Markers are now draggable during editing
* Option added to force map language - this is useful if, for example, your blog is in Spanish but many your readers have their browsers defaulted to English.  Set the option to force Google to display all map controls in that language.
* Option added to turn mouse wheel scrolling on/off
* We now have WYSIWYG map preview during post editing - map shows exactly as it'll appear in your blog
* When requesting directions, MapPress will replace invalid directions with the nearest match if it's an obvious match.  For example "1 infnte loop, coopertino" will be replaed with "1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, CA".  
* For less obvious matches, MapPress will provide "did you mean: " links.  For example, entering "ab" will result in a link "did you mean: Alberta, Canada""
